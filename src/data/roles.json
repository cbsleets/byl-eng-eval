    "name": "Builder",
    "role_desc": "Builders are oriented toward creation. They feel most alive when turning ideas into tangible reality—shipping, assembling, constructing, or making progress visible. Builders are less concerned with perfection than with momentum. For them, something imperfect that exists is almost always better than something perfect that does not.",
    "core_drive": "To create something real and concrete that did not previously exist.",
    "most_like_when": "You are actively making progress, building systems, shipping work, or seeing your efforts materialize into something others can use.",
    "core_rank_desc": "You default to action. You are energized by starting and finishing things, and you may become impatient with excessive planning or discussion. You tend to measure success by output and movement.",
    "peripheral_rank_desc": "You are more comfortable thinking, advising, or supporting than creating directly. You may prefer refinement, analysis, or stewardship over building from scratch.",
    "top_rank_desc": "Creating is central to your identity. Not building something can feel like stagnation. You often seek roles, projects, or environments where you can point to concrete outcomes and say, “I made that.”",
    "bottom_rank_desc": "Creation is rarely how you define yourself. You may actively avoid ownership of deliverables, preferring to influence outcomes indirectly or focus on people, ideas, or systems rather than outputs."

    "name": "Leader",
    "role_desc": "Leaders orient around direction and responsibility. They are comfortable being visible, making decisions that affect others, and setting a course forward. Leadership here is about identity, not authority—some people feel like leaders regardless of title, while others do not seek that role even when placed in it.",

    "most_like_when": "You are setting priorities, making calls, or taking responsibility for outcomes that extend beyond your own work.",
    "core_rank_desc": "You naturally step forward when direction is needed. You are comfortable owning decisions and being accountable for results. Ambiguity often feels like an invitation to lead.",
    "peripheral_rank_desc": "You prefer contributing without being the focal point. You may find leadership draining or unnecessary, especially if it pulls you away from hands-on or individual work.",
    "top_rank_desc": "Leadership is core to how you see yourself. You often feel responsible for outcomes even when responsibility is not formally assigned. Being “just a contributor” may feel limiting.",
    "bottom_rank_desc": "Leadership feels misaligned with your identity. You may actively avoid roles that require visibility, authority, or responsibility for others’ performance."

    "most_like_when": "Others seek you out for answers, judgment, or deep understanding in a specific domain.",
    "core_rank_desc": "You invest heavily in learning and refinement. You care about correctness and nuance, and may resist oversimplification or premature conclusions.",
    "peripheral_rank_desc": "You are comfortable operating without deep specialization. Breadth, exploration, or adaptability matters more than being the authority on any one thing.",
    "top_rank_desc": "Your identity is tightly linked to what you know. Being seen as uninformed or unprepared can feel especially threatening. You are motivated by credibility and competence.",
    "bottom_rank_desc": "Expertise is not central to how you define yourself. You may intentionally avoid narrow specialization in favor of generalist or relational identities."

    "most_like_when": "You are generating new approaches, experimenting, or proposing ideas that others have not considered.",
    "core_rank_desc": "You are comfortable with ambiguity and risk. You may grow bored with repetition or maintenance and prefer environments that reward creativity.",
    "peripheral_rank_desc": "You prefer proven approaches and incremental improvement. Reliability and consistency feel more important than novelty.",
    "top_rank_desc": "Innovation is core to your identity. You may feel constrained or disengaged in environments that resist change or experimentation.",
